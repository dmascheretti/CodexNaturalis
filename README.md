### Description
The legendary monkey Tybor Kwelein has begun compiling a manuscript that details the living species found within primary forests. Your task is to continue his work and assemble the manuscript as best as possible.
In the game, you use your hand of three cards to play resource cards and gold cards. Resource cards provide symbols you need in specific amounts and combinations to play gold cards. Occasionally, resource cards also award a single point. The symbols include purple insects, blue animals, green plants, and orange mushrooms, as well as inkwells, scrolls, and quills. Gold cards are for scoring points, using the displayed symbols to score set amounts, awarding points for each inkwell/scroll/quill on display, or scoring points for each corner of another card you cover when placing the card.
You can also play any card in your hand face down, which expands your play area and provides a permanent symbol that cannot be covered up. There are several common scoring objectives visible during the game and a private scoring condition for each player, used for end-of-game scoring. These objectives can earn you bonus points for arranging colored cards in specific layouts or for grouping symbols together.

The game concludes after a player reaches 20 points and the current round is completed.
